# database-scrapping
This is a project for a database course in The American University in Cairo (AUC).

The project was based on a satellite webpage that contained data regarding satellites. 

The project was divided into three milestones. 
- First, creating ERD and RMD and to create the database without filling in the data. But, creating the the tables.
- Second, writing a scrapping script using python to scrape the website and get all the necessary data and add it to the database.
- Finally, creating a UI (GUI was a bonus) to the user so that he can go through the database freely, search, sort, etc..
      The GUI was created using python customtkinter.
